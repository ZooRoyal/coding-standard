# ZooRoyal Coding Standard

This repository holds the necessary data to use the ZooRoyal coding standard. It incorporates
* [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) and its configuration
* [PHP Mess Detector](https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd) and its configuration
* [PHP Copy Paste Detector](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd)
* [PHP-Parallel-Lint](https://github.com/JakubOnderka/PHP-Parallel-Lint)
* [ES-LINT](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and its configuration
* [STYLE-LINT](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) and its configuration

Furthermore there is a php script in src/bin which is meant to be used in the .travis build file. It searches your source code for files to check by its static code analysis tools. Information about its usage can be found by calling it with -h option.

# Installation

To install this package just run

```bash
composer require --dev "zooroyal/coding-standard"
```

## Eslint and StyleLint

In case you want to use eslint and stylelint checks you have to install the packages from the package.json in the root folder of your project.

## Example `sca:all`

```bash
vendor/bin/coding-standard sca:all -h
```
```
Usage:
  sca:all [options]

Options:
  -t, --target=TARGET      Finds Files which have changed since the current branch parted from the target 
                           branch only. The Value has to be a commit-ish. [default: false]
  -a, --auto-target        Finds Files which have changed since the current branch parted from the parent 
                           branch only. It tries to find the parent branch by automagic.
  -f, --fix                Runs tool to try to fix violations automagically.
  -p, --process-isolation  Runs all checks in separate processes. Slow but not as resource hungry.
  -h, --help               Display this help message
  -q, --quiet              Do not output any message
  -V, --version            Display this application version
      --ansi               Force ANSI output
      --no-ansi            Disable ANSI output
  -n, --no-interaction     Do not ask any interactive question
  -v|vv|vvv, --verbose     Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output 
                           and 3 for debug

Help:
  This tool executes all static code analysis tools on files of this project. It ignores files which are in 
  directories with a .dont<toolshortcut> file. Subdirectories are ignored too.
```

The all command forwards all applicable parameters to all implemented static code analysis tools.

```bash
vendor/bin/coding-standard sca:all -a -f
```

This command for example tries to find the parent branch by automagic (-a) and tells all static code analysis 
tools to fix found violations if they are able to.

```bash
vendor/bin/coding-standard sca:all -t origin/master
```

This command computes the diff to the branch origin/master and searches for all violations in this files.

For examples just have a look an the .travis.yml
